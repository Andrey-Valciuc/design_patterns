# Design Patterns

Design patterns are the useful structures, styles, and stencils that our code sits within. A
design pattern may prescribe anything from the overall scaffolding of a code base to the
individual syntactic pieces used to build expressions, functions, and modules.

## Architectural Design Patterns

Architectural design patterns are the ways in which we tie our code together. If we have a
dozen different modules, it is how those modules talk to each other that defines our
architecture:

- [MVC](https://github.com/Andrey-Valciuc/design_patterns/tree/main/design_patterns/ArchitecturalDesignPatetrns/MVC)
- [MVVM](https://github.com/Andrey-Valciuc/design_patterns/tree/main/design_patterns/ArchitecturalDesignPatetrns/MVVM)
