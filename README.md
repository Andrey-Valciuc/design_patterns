# Design Patterns

Design patterns are the useful structures, styles, and stencils that our code sits within. A
design pattern may prescribe anything from the overall scaffolding of a code base to the
individual syntactic pieces used to build expressions, functions, and modules.

## Architectural Design Patterns

Architectural design patterns are the ways in which we tie our code together. If we have a
dozen different modules, it is how those modules talk to each other that defines our
architecture:

- [MVC](https://github.com/Andrey-Valciuc/design_patterns/tree/main/design_patterns/ArchitecturalDesignPatetrns/MVC)
- [MVVM](https://github.com/Andrey-Valciuc/design_patterns/tree/main/design_patterns/ArchitecturalDesignPatetrns/MVVM)

## Modular Design Patterns

Modular design patterns are the structures and syntactic conventions we use to craft
individual modules. We would usually employ these patterns within distinct JavaScript
Modules. Each distinct file should offer up and export a specific abstraction.
